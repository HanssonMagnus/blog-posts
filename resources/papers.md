Academic papers provide an opportunity to gain concise knowledge quickly. Some renowned books are,
in fact, based on celebrated academic articles, and reading these original articles can often be
more advantageous than reading the full books. Below you will find a collection of noteworthy
papers - both famous and those that deserve to be - that I have found particularly compelling or
influential.
