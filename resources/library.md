Note: Don't judge this digital bookshelf by its cover! While I've gathered a variety of books in
this digital library, it's worth noting that I haven't read each one, and not all of the ones I've
read align with my personal preferences. Nevertheless, this collection represents an array of
topics that have sparked my interest. I warmly welcome any book recommendations you may have or
discussions about the literature presented here. Please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Many books in the public domain can be accessed at [Gutenberg.org](http://www.gutenberg.org/).
