# Poetry: Python packaging and dependency management made easy

## Resources
- [poetry docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/)
- [poetry github](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

## Introduction
From poetry's github: `poetry` is a tool to handle dependency installation as well as building and
packaging of Python packages. It only needs one file to do all of that: the new, standardized
`pyproject.toml`.

In other words, `poetry` uses `pyproject.toml` to replace `setup.py`, `requirements.txt`,
`setup.cfg`, `MANIFEST.in` and `Pipfile`.

Tab completion can also be added with `poetry completions bash >> ~/.bash_completion`.

## Installation
When installing packages it's always best to look at the official documentation. However, when
writing the installation process was very simple,
```
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```
Once installed it can be updated with `poetry self update`.

## Usage
A Python project can easily be initiated with `poetry new project-name`. This will yield the
following directory structure,
```
project-name
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── project_name
│   └── __init__.py
└── tests
    └── __init__.py
```

A virtual environment can be initiated with `poetry shell`.

The `pyproject.toml` file handles the whole project. Instead of adding dependencies to the file you
can run, e.g., `poetry add graphene` to add the `graphene` package as a project dependency.
Dependencies can be installed with `poetry install`.

The `run` command executes the given command inside the project’s virtual environment. E.g., you
can run a script file with `poetry run python main.py`.

With `poetry build` you can package your library into `sdist` (source format) and
`wheel` (compiled format). Now your ready to publish your library. You can publish directly to PyPI
with `poetry publish`.
