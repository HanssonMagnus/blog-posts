# AMD Ryzen 9 5950X on X370 Chipset

## Resources
- [X370-Pro Motherboard
  Compatibility](https://www.asus.com/Motherboards-Components/Motherboards/PRIME/PRIME-X370-PRO/HelpDesk_CPU/)

## Introduction
AMD has released support for their 5000 series on the X370 chipset. However, the motherboard
manufacturer has to make sure that the BIOS is stable, and we need to make sure that our specific
motherboard has support. Thus, confirming compatibility on the manufacturers website is crucial.

The Ryzen 9 5950X has 3.4GHz and 16 cores (32 threads). This will be a significant improvement to
my older Ryzen 5 1600 with 3.3GHz and 6 cores (12 threads). Both single core and multicore work
will be multiple times faster.

## Parts
* Motherboard: Asus Prime X370-Pro
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X
* Cooler: Noctua NH-D15
* Case: Fractal Design Meshify C

You can get your motherboard info with `sudo dmidecode -t 2` and you can check your BIOS version
with `sudo dmidecode -s bios-version`.

## Steps
* Upgrade BIOS to newest version (as of today 6042).
* Remove the old cooler and CPU.
* Switch to Ryzen 9 5950X.
* Install Noctua CPU cooler.

## Upgrading BIOS on Asus Prime X370-Pro

#### Download the BIOS upgrade
First we download the BIOS 6042 update from Asus
[website](https://www.asus.com/Motherboards-Components/Motherboards/PRIME/PRIME-X370-PRO/HelpDesk_BIOS/).
This is a `.zip` file with two files in it:
- `PRIME-X370-PRO-ASUS-6042.CAP`
- `BIOSRenamer.exe`

`BIOSRenamer.exe` renames `PRIME-X370-PRO-ASUS-6042.CAP` to `X370PRO.CAP`. However, I skipped this
step and used the original name of the `.CAP` file. I would guess that if you want the motherboard
to automatically recognize the USB drive, without you having to point the current BIOS GUI to the
file it might be necessary to rename the file. In the manual it also says what to rename the file
to, if you want to do that manually on Linux.

#### Format FAT32 USB
My initial idea was to use the "internet update function" of the Ez flash utility available for the Asus Prime
X370-Pro. However, I did not get internet access. The reason might be that I'm using a WiFi card in
on my desktop.

In order to flash a USB drive to fat32 and copy the `.CAP` file to the drive,
```
sudo umount /dev/sde1
sudo mkfs.vfat /dev/sde1
sudo fsck /dev/sde1
sudo mount /dev/sde1 /media/usb/
cd /media/usb/
sudo cp ~/Downloads/asus/PRIME-X370-PRO-ASUS-6042.CAP .
```

#### Flashing
Have the USB drive plugged in, reboot, press `del`, navigate to Ez flashing, select the file in the
USB drive and flash. When the system reboots the screen will be black for a while and then it says
"BIOS is updating". Running `sudo dmidecode -s bios-version` now yields `6042`.

#### After flashing
I've read reports saying that they've had problems with HDMI or booting or similar after flashing
the BIOS. Perhaps these reports were from the beta version of the BIOS update. I've had no problems
at all. After the upgrade it was simply plug and play.

Update 2022-07-20:
Others have experienced [random reboots](https://www.reddit.com/r/ryzen/comments/k9rs1y/random_reboots_ryzen_5950x/)
with the 5950X CPU. I had one overnight reboot when running a job. Manually overclocking the CPU at
1.1750 V and 44.50 on each CCX seems to solve the issue.

#### Removing the old cooler and CPU
I had some trouble removing the old CPU cooler from the CPU. Recommendation are to run an CPU intensive
job to warm the CPU or use a hairdryer so that the thermal paste gets warm. This did not help, and
I ended up removing the cooler with the CPU on. Normally, the CPU should stay in the motherboard
socket. Although, everything seems to be working and no pins were bent on the old CPU.

#### Install the new processor
Placing the new CPU in the socket,

#### Install the new cooler
Adding thermal paste and placing the cooler,

I have a Fractal Design Meshify C case and everything fit in the case. The only minor adjustment
was that I had to place the fan slightly off such that the memory sticks could fit.

Lastly, we'll have to end with a classic `neofetch` to show off the setup,
