## TLP laptop battery management
TLP is a battery management tool that is by default optimized after Powertop's recommendations.
To install TLP together with acpi_call (for Thinkpads),
```
sudo pacman -S tlp acpi_call
```
After installation we need to enable the service and we can check the tlp battery status,
```
sudo systemctl enable tlp.service
sudo tlp-stat -b
```
Here we can see,
```
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_control_start_threshold =     0 [%]
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT1/charge_control_end_threshold   =     100 [%]
```
The default values are optimized for runtime however not for battery lifespan (this is a trade off).
The values in these files can be changed to more appropriate values for battery health, such as 40
and 80. Note that these levels do not control the discharging of the battery which only depends on
if the AC is connected and/or the laptop is switched on. This means that if the AC is plugged in
and the battery level is higher than the threshold it will not discharged down to the threshold
level.

The same can also be done with,
```
sudo tlp setcharge 40 80 BAT1
```
Note that these changes are only temporary. If you want permanent changes you'll need to
configure the config file at `/etc/tlp.conf` and set,
```
START_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT1=40
STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT1=80
```
