# Make a Usb Cable

<img src="/images/cable.jpg" width="500">

## What you will need
Depending on where you live it can be hard to source all the material you need, but you can order
everything on AliExpress.

#### Material
* Usb cable
* Paracord
* Techflex (optional)
* Heat shrink
* USB A connector
* USB c/mini/micro connector
* Detachable connector (optional)

Although the usb 2.0 standard requires a shielded cable it is not necessary, especially depending
on the application. I will use my cable for my keyboard and then shielding is not needed.

#### Equipment
* Soldering iron
* Cutting nippers
* Pliers
* Heat gun
* Wire stripper (28 gauge/0.32mm diameter/0.08mm2)
* Helping hand

## Process and steps
All you have to do is sleeve your cable, solder the connectors, and use heat shrink. Although the
steps are clear, it can be a bit tricky. E.g., you need the right amount of wire exposed when
soldering the connectors. If you have too little it is hard to get the wires to fit on the
connectors, and if you have too much wire exposed the housing of the connectors will not reach to
surround the thick part of the cable.

It can be a good idea to watch someone make a cable before you do it yourself. Especially if you
are planning to make a coiled cable, without the right technique it can end up looking a bit
strange. The youtube channel CruzCtrl is great,

## Note on detachable connectors
There are a ton of different detachable connectors that you can use when making your usb
cable. The important thing is that it is a 4 pin connector, such that is matches the usb
standard. These have been very popular lately in the keyboard community. The Aviator connector is
the most common one and comes in different sizes. The GX12 and the GX16 are the most common ones,
I have a couple of GX12 at home which I think is a quite nice size for a usb cable.
The YC8 connector is slimmer than the Aviator. Then there are also Limo connectors and
Mini-XLR connectors, they are quite similar to the YC8, although more expensive.
